OpenMP and Diameter of Graph
----------------------------
This project experiment OpenMP programming for computing the diameter of a graph. The objective is to achieve the maximum speedup possible.

This assignment work is done for COMP90025 Project 1B assessment 2016 SM2, The University of Melbourne. You can read [the report](SanKhoLin_829463_COMP90025_Project1B_Report.pdf). You may also want to read the related [`mpi-graph-diameter`](https://github.com/victorskl/mpi-graph-diameter) assignment. The implementation still has room for improvement. You may wish to cite this work as follow.
